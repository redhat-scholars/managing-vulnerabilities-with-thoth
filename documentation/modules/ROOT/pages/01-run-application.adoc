This might take some time. Once Thoth recommends you the application stack to be used for running the application, you can use Thamos to create a Python environment (based on configuration in ``.thoth.yaml``) and install the recommended requirements into it:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
thamos install

And finally, run the application:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
thamos run ./game_of_life.py

[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
